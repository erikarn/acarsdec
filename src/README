Acarsdec is a multi-channels acars decoder with built-in rtl_sdr front end.

The 2.0 version is a complete rewrite, very few code line remains from 1.x

Features :

 - new and improved msk demodulator
 - up to four channels decoded simultaneously
 - multithreaded
 - error detection AND correction (correct all one error and some two errors)
 - input from sound file (.wav) , alsa sound card or software defined radio (SRD) via a rtl dongle (http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr) 

The 4 channels decoding is particularly useful with the rtl dongle. It allows to directly listen simultaneously to 4 different frequencies , with a very low cost hardware.


Usage :
 acarsdec  [-v] [-o lv] -a alsapcmdevice  | -f sndfile | -r rtldevicenumber  f1 [f2] [f3] [f4] 

 -f sndfile :		decode from sound file (ie: a .wav file)
 -a alsapcmdevice :	decode from sound-card  (ie: hw:0,0)
 -r rtldevicenumber  f1 [f2] [f3] [f4] :
			decode from rtl dongle number 'rtldevicenumber' receiving at VHF frequencies f1 and optionally f2 to f4 in MHz (ie : -r 0 131.525 131.725 131.825 )
 -v :			verbose mode 
 -o lv :		output format : 0 one liner, 1 full (default) 


Examples :

Decoding from multichannel wav file :
acarsdec -f test.wav 

Decoding from sound card with short output :
acarsdec -o 0 -a hw:0,0

Decoding from rtl dongle number 0 on 3 frequencies with verbose output :
acarsdec -v -r 0 131.525 131.725 131.825


Compilation :
acarsdec must compile directly on any modern Linux distrib.
It has been tested on x86_64 with fedora 19.

It depends of 3 external libraries :
 - libsndfile for sound file input (rpm package libsndfile-devel on fedora)
 - libasound  for sound card input (rpm package alsa-lib-devel on fedora)
 - librtlsdr for software radio rtl dongle input (http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr)

If you don't have or don't need one of these libs, edit, at the beginning of acarsdec.h, the #define to opt-out corresponding code and edit the LDLIBS setting in Makefile.

Testing :
acarsdec-2.0.tar include a test.wav file. It's a 4 channels audio file that contains 7 acars messages.
